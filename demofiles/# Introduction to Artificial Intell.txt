# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. AI has become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve complex problems in various domains.

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
- Supervised Learning: Models learn from labeled data
- Unsupervised Learning: Models find patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: Models learn through trial and error

## Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain, allowing it to learn from large amounts of data.

Important neural network architectures include:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data
- Transformers for natural language processing

## Applications of AI

AI is transforming numerous industries:
1. Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery
2. Finance: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading
3. Transportation: Autonomous vehicles
4. Education: Personalized learning experiences
5. Entertainment: Content recommendation systems
